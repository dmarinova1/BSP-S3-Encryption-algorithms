\subsection{Requirements ($\pm$ 15\% total words)}
Describe here all the properties that characterize the deliverables you produce. It should describe what are those deliverables, who are the actors exploiting the deliverables, what are the expected functional and non functional qualities of the deliverables.

One of the deliverables of this project is a Python chat system. The application encrypts messages and employs ciphers reviewed in this report. Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum in late 1980s in the Netherlands. It is named after a BBC comedy show called Monty Python's Flying Circus. Python is a free software and the latest version can be downloaded from \url{www.python.org}. Python is a simple and very powerful general purpose computer programming language. It is very readable, useful and easy to learn. Python is an open source language with volunteers constantly trying to improve it. This allows for the language to remain fresh and current with the newest trends. Python has libraries for just about everything. It can be used for web development, web scraping, writing scripts, browser automation, GUI development, data analysis, machine learning, computer vision, game development to name just a few. In addition, Python is an object-oriented programming language (OOP). There are four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. Before OOP there is procedural programming, a simple and straightforward programming, that divides a program into a set of functions. However, as our programs grow we end up with \emph{spaghetti code}, i.e. many functions all over the place that are interdependent. Thus, OOP offers a solution to this issue. We can bundle a group of related variables (referred to as properties) and functions (referred to as methods) that operate on them into an object. This grouping is called encapsulation. Using this technique, we can reduce complexity and increase reusability.In Python, objects are data and have a certain type (integer, float, list, etc.). Once we have created our objects we can manipulate and interact with them (append, sort, delete, concatenate, etc.). We can hide the details and complexity (e.g. some methods and properties) from the outside and show only the essentials. This gives us benefits such as simpler interface and reduction of the impact of change (i.e. no inner changes leak to the outside of the contained object). Inheritance is a mechanism allows us to eliminate redundant code. Polymorphism means \emph{many forms} and is a technique that allows us to refactor long if/ else or switch/case statements. 

On macOS, we can open Python on a Terminal. Moreover, we can use any Text Editor or IDLE of our choice. For this project, we have used the source code editor Visual Studio Code (VSC) developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Our platform is macOS. VSC is a lightweight yet powerful editor. It offers support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, snippets, extensions, smart code completion and code refactoring. 

A GitHub repository was set up to share and build our project. The link is provided in the annex of the report. GitHub is a web-based hosting service of open source projects for version control using Git.
