\section{Conclusion}

The security of data that flows through communication channels is an important aspect in the world of software development. Thus, transferring data over the Internet requires higher level of security when it comes to sensitive information. It could be achieved through the means of cryptosystems and cryptography. Primitives of symmetric-key cryptography lay the foundation of our report. Surveying its mechanisms, we have implemented a simple chat application in Python that encrypts messages before transferring them over the Internet. Substitution and transposition ciphers, alongside block and stream ciphers have been introduced in our project. The palette of reviewed ciphers stretches from simple to more complex ones: Caesar cipher, ROT13, One-time pad, Vigenere cipher, Enigma machine, Rivest Cipher 4, Data Encryption Standard (DES), 3DES, Advanced Encryption Standard. Existing modes of operations (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR)  that could be applied to block and stream ciphers are also presented as they allow for larger data to be encrypted in order to guarantee its confidentiality.
