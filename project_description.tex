\section{Project description ($\pm$ 10\% total words) }
\subsection{Domain}
The report draws on a variety of disciplines. However, it is impossible to appreciate the vastness and significance of the topic in a limited amount of content pages. Nevertheless, we attempt at making the report self-contained by providing the reader with an intuitive understanding of our survey and application results.
The domains that are associated with our project are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Internet security: "measures to protect data during its transmission over a collection of interconnected networks" [Stallings, ed.3,]
\end {itemize}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Computer Security: "generic name for the collection of tools designed to protect data and to thwart hackers and malicious software (viruses) " [Stallings, ed.3,]; at its heart there are three key objectives: confidentiality, integrity and availability
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cryptographic primitives
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Symmetric-key cryptography
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cryptographic algorithms: "study of techniques for ensuring the secrecy and/or authenticity of information => 3 main studies of this category (1) symmetric encryption, (2) asymmetric encryption and (3) cryptographic hash functions" [Stallings, 5th ed, p. 3]
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Objectives}
We aim for a comprehensive survey of both principles and practice of cryptography and network security. The objectives of this project are three-fold. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  As a preliminary task, we address a highly needed background material. We give a basic introduction to the concepts and primitives of cryptography, i.e. transposition/permutation, encryption/decryption, symmetry/asymmetry, block ciphers/stream ciphers and how they obtain their security in constantly emerging attacks
\item  Our main focus falls on symmetric encryption, taking into account both classical and modern algorithms. Therefore,  we explore the following encryption algorithms: Caesar cipher, ROT13, One-time pad, DES, 3DES, AES in order to yield two types of approaches: information theoretic and computational
\item Lastly, we implement an encrypted chat system that could be of use to provide network security.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Constraints}
Our project takes into account substitution/transposition; block/stream ciphers but we do not consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item Asymmetric ciphers (public-key algorithms, including RSA and elliptic curve); 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data integrity algorithms (cryptographic hash functions, message authentication codes (MACs); digital signatures)); 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication techniques: key management and key distribution topics (protocols for key exchange);
\end{itemize}
