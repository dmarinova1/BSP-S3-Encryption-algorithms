\subsection{Domain}
The report draws on a variety of disciplines. However, it is impossible to appreciate the vastness and significance of the topic in a limited amount of content pages. Nevertheless, we attempt at making the report self-contained by providing the reader with an intuitive understanding of our survey and application results.
The domains that are associated with our project are: 
-	Internet security: "measures to protect data during its transmission over a collection of interconnected networks" [Stallings, ed.3,]
-	Computer Security: "generic name for the collection of tools designed to protect data and to thwart hackers and malicious software (viruses) " [Stallings, ed.3,]; at its heart there are three key objectives: confidentiality, integrity and availability
-	Cryptographic primitives
-	Symmetric-key cryptography
-	cryptographic algorithms: "study of techniques for ensuring the secrecy and/or authenticity of information => 3 main studies of this category (1) symmetric encryption, (2) asymmetric encryption and (3) cryptographic hash functions" [Stallings, 5th ed, p. 3]



\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this project are three-fold. It We aim for a comprehensive survey of both principles and practice of cryptography and network security. In a first part, we address a highly needed background material.  Our main focus falls on symmetric encryption, including classical and modern algorithms. We give a basic introduction to the concepts of block ciphers and stream ciphers and how they obtain their security. We put emphasis on DES, AES (+ other??) algorithms. Then, we implement an encrypted chat system that could be of use to provide network security.
\subsection{Constraints}
Our project takes into account substitution/transposition; block/stream ciphers but we do not consider:
-	Asymmetric ciphers (public-key algorithms, including RSA and elliptic curve); 
-	Data integrity algorithms (cryptographic hash functions (message authentication codes (MACs); digital signatures)); 
-	Authentication techniques: key management and key distribution topics (protocols for key exchange)
